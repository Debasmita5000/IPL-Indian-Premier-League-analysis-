üöÄ Excited to share my latest project! üèè

As a part of my data analysis journey, I created an interactive IPL Analysis Dashboard in Excel, delving into the rich history of the 
Indian Premier League (IPL). This dashboard highlights team performances, toss decisions, match outcomes, and key player statistics over the years.
By leveraging Excel's advanced features, I was able to provide clear insights on how teams have performed based on different 
strategies and venue conditions. 

1.Objectives:
i)Analyze team performance in the IPL across different seasons (since 2008).
ii)Evaluate match outcomes based on batting or fielding first and toss decisions.
iii)Identify the top venues and their win patterns based on batting or fielding.
iv)Highlight title winners and standout players, including top Man of the Match (MOM) award winners.

2.Key Insights:
i) Mumbai Indians lead with 98 total wins, excelling both while batting first and chasing.
ii) Teams choosing to field after winning the toss have a higher win percentage (59%) than those batting first (41%).
iii) M Chinnaswamy Stadium shows a stark contrast, with teams opting to field winning 64 times, compared to just 9 wins when batting first.
iv)Chris Gayle dominates the MOM awards with 20 accolades, followed closely by AB de Villiers (18) and Rohit Sharma (15).
v)Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians lead with 3 titles each, showcasing their consistency and dominance.
3.Conclusion:This dashboard provided a comprehensive analysis of IPL matches, offering insights into how different teams and strategies have evolved over the years. 
It highlights the critical role of toss decisions and venue performance, while also celebrating the standout players and title-winning teams.
